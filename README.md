## Design

### Logo

A cup of coffee with a heart and the coffee shop name in a font face that has rounded letters for all the comfy vibes.

Designed and downloaded for free on [FreeLogoDesign](https://www.freelogodesign.org/). _(not sponsored)_

<img alt="Logo" src="./img/logo.png">

### Fonts

[Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) - this font is used for everything because the roundness in the font gives comfy vibes to match Comfy Coffee's branding.

<img alt="Font Example Screenshot" src="./img/nunito.png">

### Color Scheme

- Harvest Gold - only used in the logo, but the rest of the color palette was made around it
- Antique Fushia - call to action buttons
- Isabelline - text background color and sign in & join hover background color
- Rich Black FORGRA 39 - black text color instead of normal #000 black
- Dim Gray - footer list items and copyright text
